# traffic-indicators-interstate

This is a Pandas data analysis project.

The goal of this analysis is to determine a few indicators of heavy westbound traffic on I-94 - a 1,010-mile corridor that crosses five states Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. These indicators can be weather type, time of the day, time of the week, etc.
